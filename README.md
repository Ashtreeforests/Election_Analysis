## Election-Audit Summary
The election audit was expanded to include voter turnout by county for the candidates. This expansion was intended to include a platform for the analysis of future elections. Specifically, factors that may influence the outcome of voter turnout. We could do this by taking a closer look at the percentages of voters for each candidate and county by adding "if statements" to upgrade the code.
